# Homework 3 - 3 Levels of Calculator


## Purpose:
Try to make the most complete calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Be able to store a history of calculations. 
Practice object oriented programming and design principles.

# Design Principles
1. SOLID
2. DRY
3. GRASP
4. Separation of Concerns
5. OOP

# Object-Oriented Programming
1. Encapsulation 
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism


## Objectives
1. Add, subtract, mulitply, and divide
2. Have a throw exception for divide by zero
3. Use class, static methods, and class methods
4. Store history of calculations
5. Test code using pytest, pylint, and coverage
6. Use type hints for input parameter and return types
7. Implement pytest fixture


## Repository Branches
1. Main - Basic calculator with functions
2. Part 2 (Intermediate) - Try to introduce static methods on Calculator class and instance methods on Calculation class to perform operations on data in calculation instance
3. Part 3 (Advanced) - Attempt using OOP Principals (SOLID, DRY, GRASP, Separation of Concerns)
